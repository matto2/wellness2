Healthy digestive function is essential for maintaining one’s health and having the ongoing energy to participate in daily life in a steady and grounded way. When digestion is working properly, the food that we intake is broken down and nutrients are provided to all our cells for healing, sustenance, and energy production. The digestive system is also critical for detoxifying the body by providing an exit route for unwanted waste material.

Digestive disorders are rampant in the United States. Surveys estimate nearly 70 million people in the United States are affected by some sort of digestive disorder. This could be anything from gallstones to acid reflux to pancreatitis. For many, these disorders are extremely debilitating. But for every person dealing with a debilitating digestive disorder, there are thousands more that just assume everything they are experiencing is “normal.”

## Acupuncture and the Gut-Brain Axis

Acupuncture helps by balancing the gut-brain axis and the nervous system to reduce stress, which in turn improves digestive function. One of the side effects of an overactive sympathetic nervous system is decreased digestive function. The vagus nerve, which is responsible for the “rest and digest” function and heart rhythm, can be affected—leading to stress in the gut. Without the parasympathetic influence that the vagus nerve brings to our body, digestive and emotional imbalances are created.

Acupuncture also helps reduce pain and inflammation, which helps regulate stomach acid and promote peristalsis.

## The Role of Chinese Herbs

Chinese herbs are often used for digestive issues, either alone or in conjunction with acupuncture treatments. They are taken internally and work to adjust digestion like food supplements or diet modification. Common herbs like **ginger** and **licorice** can help improve digestion and have been used for hundreds of years by many cultures around the world.

## A TCM Perspective on the Digestive System

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the digestive system includes the **Spleen**, **Stomach**, **Large Intestine**, and **Small Intestine**. If any of these organ systems are out of balance, the impact can be felt throughout our digestive process. Symptoms can include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, distention, edema, unclear thinking, and difficulty sleeping.

These four organs and their functional ability also operate as a foundation for the other organ systems by transforming the nutrients that are later made into **qi** and **blood**, which feed all of the tissues and the body as a whole. If you suffer from digestive disorders, this weakened foundation can slowly fail to create the qi and blood that your body needs to feel strong and capable.

## 5 Reasons Acupuncture Can Help With Digestive Function

1. **Holistic Treatment**  
   Acupuncture treats the person holistically. All parts are considered during treatment—there is no compartmentalizing as in Western medicine. The connection between the mind and body is key to understanding and treating digestive disorders.

2. **Stimulates Peristalsis**  
   Studies have shown acupuncture can stimulate peristalsis in the intestinal tract. This is very helpful for people who deal with chronic constipation. In as few as one to two treatments, relief is often achieved.

3. **Eases Nausea and Vomiting**  
   Acupuncture and even acupressure are excellent tools for calming upset stomachs. One specific acupressure point on the underside of the forearm has been studied extensively for reducing nausea. Most people see noticeable improvement.

4. **Reduces Bloating**  
   Bloating is a common issue often caused by overeating or improper digestion. Acupuncture supports the body’s ability to break down food without producing excess gas.

5. **Relieves Diarrhea**  
   Diarrhea can result from excess heat or dampness in the digestive tract. Acupuncture can help resolve it by clearing those imbalances and strengthening the digestive system.

## What the Research Says

> A growing body of literature continues to support the efficacy of acupuncture for alleviating adverse gastrointestinal symptoms associated with various GI disorders. Current evidence indicates the potential for acupuncture to treat GI disorders through regulating intestinal motility, reducing visceral sensitivity, antagonizing intestinal inflammation, and modulating neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in the gut-brain axis.
